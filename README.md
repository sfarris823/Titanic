# Titanic
A study of the Titanic Kaggle Competition and my first attempt using Git/GitHub integrated with RStudio.

The work for this project is based on the "Intro to Data Science with R" YouTube video series by David Langer (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTJTBoU5HOCRrTs3cJK-PbHM39cwCU0PF).
